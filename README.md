# Non-Uniform Samling of Fixed Binary Matrices

This software accompanies the 2020 Foundations of Data Science Conference paper, Non-Uniform Sampling of Fixed Binary Matrices ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15043)).
We implemented weighted versions of checkerboard swapping and the curveball algorithm in order to sample from fixed margin binary matrices non-uniformly.
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant IOS-1856229.

Weighted checkerboard swap and weighted curveball are implemented in `functions.r`

Scripts with numbers correspond to the associated sections in the paper.
