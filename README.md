# Non-Uniform Samling of Fixed BInary Matrices

This software accompanies the 2020 Foundations of Data Science Conference paper, Non-Uniform Sampling of Fixed Binary Matrices.
We implemented weighted versions of checkerboard swapping and the curveball algorithm in order to sample from fixed margin binary matrices non-uniformly.
